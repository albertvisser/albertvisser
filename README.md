I'm Dutch, but that's not the reason I program in Python a lot. 
Ever since it got to know the language I found it very helpful to develop tools to assist me in my workflow, and Python made that very easy.
Luckily I could do a lot of that before my employer prohibited the use of unofficially installed applications.

These days I treat programming in my own time like another would treat computer gaming (which I also do).
